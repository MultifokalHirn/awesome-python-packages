> These all look awesome - future me must be so excited to try all of them out!

#### Testing

- [`pytest-watch`](https://github.com/joeyespo/pytest-watch) - a zero-config CLI tool that runs pytest, and re-runs it when a file in your project changes. It beeps on failures and can run arbitrary commands on each passing and failing test run.

## ğŸ«¡ Status: *was awesome*

> Oh Oh! ğŸš¨ Personal Opinion Alert! ğŸš¨ These packages were awesome (and probably still are), but either I have found something that I like better, or they were abandoned/are kaput/took an arrow to the knee or some other unfortunate fate like that.

- [`flake8`](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8)
